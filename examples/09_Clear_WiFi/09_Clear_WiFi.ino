 *   ThingsLinker — Clear WiFi & Re-Provision
 * ================================================
 *
 * Use this sketch to:
 *   - Erase saved WiFi credentials
 *   - Restart BLE provisioning (change networks)
 *   - Factory-reset the device WiFi configuration
 *
 * Steps:
 *   1. Fill in your credentials below
 *   2. Upload the sketch
 *   3. Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
 *   4. When "BLE PROVISIONING ACTIVE" appears,
 *      open the ThingsLinker app to provision WiFi
 *
 * After successful provisioning:
 *   - Device saves the new WiFi credentials to flash
 *   - App confirms onboarding → device restarts
 *   - On next boot the device auto-connects (no BLE)
 *
 * To re-provision again: upload this sketch again
 * or call iot.resetWiFi() in your own code.
 * ================================================
